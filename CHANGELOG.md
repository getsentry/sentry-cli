## sentry-cli 0.21.1

* Resolved an issue where release builds of react-native would not automatically find the
  sourcemap references

## sentry-cli 0.21.0

* Upon sourcemap uploading the `sentry-cli` tool is now automatically attempting to find
  matching sourcemaps and emit a `Sourcemap` header with the correct reference. This helps
  in situations like react-native where the source reference in the file is malformed or
  points to a non existing file by default
* fixed a bug with the `--rewrite` flag on the upload sourcemaps tool which caused
  incorrect sources to be inlined. This is now properly supported.
* `--strip-common-prefix` on the upload sourcemaps tool now skips over paths which are not
  absolute.

## sentry-cli 0.20.0

* added support for sourcemap rewriting. This will automatically inline sourcecode and
  flatten indexed sourcemaps and can optionally remove prefixes from source paths. This is
  useful for react native which otherwise will not work since sourcecode is not contained.
