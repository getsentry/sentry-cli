# Sentry CLI Development Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is **sentry-cli**, a command-line utility for working with Sentry. It's primarily written in **Rust** with **JavaScript/Node.js** wrapper components for npm distribution.

## Language & Architecture

- **Primary language**: Rust (core functionality)
- **Secondary language**: JavaScript/TypeScript (npm wrapper, installation scripts)
- **Build system**: Cargo for Rust, npm/yarn for JavaScript
- **Cross-platform**: Supports multiple architectures (darwin, linux, windows, ARM variants)
- **Binary distributions**: Located in `npm-binary-distributions/` for different platforms

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Core Rust source code with command modules and utilities
- `js/` - JavaScript wrapper and npm package code
- `scripts/` - Build, installation, and deployment scripts
- `tools/` - Development tooling and utilities (commit hooks, validation scripts)
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests using `.trycmd` format
- `npm-binary-distributions/` - Platform-specific binary packages
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows (follows reusable workflow pattern)

## Development Standards

### Commit Message Format

**MUST follow Sentry's commit message format**: `type(scope): subject`

Valid types: `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `ref`, `style`, `test`, `meta`, `license`, `revert`

Subject requirements:

- Capitalize first letter
- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- No trailing period
- Max 70 characters for header

### Performance & Scale Considerations

- CLI tool should be fast and responsive
- Consider impact on cold start times
- Memory usage matters for CI environments
- Network operations should be optimized and retryable

### Security Best Practices

- Handle authentication tokens securely
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Consider impact of processing user-provided files (sourcemaps, debug files)
- Follow Rust security best practices

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests alongside source code
- Integration tests using `.trycmd` format in `tests/integration/`
- Mock HTTP responses in `tests/integration/_responses/`
- Test fixtures in `tests/integration/_fixtures/`
- Cross-platform testing via CI matrix

Remember: This is a production tool used by many developers. Changes should be well-tested, backward-compatible, and follow established patterns.
