# CI/CD Workflow Guidelines

## Reusable Workflow Pattern

- Main `ci.yml` calls separate workflows (`lint.yml`, `test.yml`, etc.)
- Extract actual logic into separate workflows that `ci.yml` calls
- Use `uses: ./.github/workflows/workflow-name.yml` pattern

## Required Checks Pattern

- All workflows must pass before merge via "Check required jobs" pattern
- Update the `required` job dependencies when adding new workflows
- Branch protection relies on this "Check required jobs" validation

## Test Matrix Requirements

- Test matrix should cover primary platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Consider impact on binary distribution pipeline
- Cross-platform testing is essential

## Branch Protection

- Main branches (`master`, `1.x`, `release/**`) are protected
- Merge strategy: Primarily squash merging, some rebase merging allowed
- Restrict pushes to protected branches (force use of PRs)

## Adding New Workflows

When adding new CI checks:

1. Create separate reusable workflow file
2. Call it from main `ci.yml`
3. Add to `required` job dependencies
4. Test across platform matrix

## Specific Workflows

- `lint.yml`: Rustfmt, Clippy, cross-platform
- `test.yml`: Rust tests with feature matrix
- `test_node.yml`: JavaScript/Node.js tests
- `swift-test.yml`: Apple catalog parsing tests

## Release Process

- Uses `.craft.yml` for release automation
- Platform-specific binary builds
- npm package publishing coordination
- Docker image releases (edge/latest tags)

## Environment Variables in CI

- `RUSTFLAGS: -Dwarnings` enforced in CI
- Feature flag testing: `-Funstable-mobile-app`
- Cross-platform matrix: Ubuntu 24.04, macOS 14, Windows 2022
