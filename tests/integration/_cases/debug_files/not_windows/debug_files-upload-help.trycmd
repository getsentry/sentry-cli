$ sentry-cli debug-files upload --help
? success
Upload debugging information files.

Usage: sentry-cli[EXE] debug-files upload [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

Arguments:
  [PATH]...  A path to search recursively for symbol files.

Options:
  -o, --org <ORG>                The organization ID or slug.
      --url <URL>                Fully qualified URL to the Sentry server.
                                 [default: https://sentry.io/]
      --header <KEY:VALUE>       Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
                                 in key:value format.
  -p, --project <PROJECT>        The project ID or slug.
      --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>  Use the given Sentry auth token.
  -t, --type <TYPE>              Only consider debug information files of the given type.  By
                                 default, all types are considered. [possible values: bcsymbolmap,
                                 breakpad, dsym, elf, jvm, pdb, pe, portablepdb, sourcebundle, wasm]
      --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>    Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info,
                                 warn, error]
      --no-unwind                Do not scan for stack unwinding information. Specify this flag for
                                 builds with disabled FPO, or when stackwalking occurs on the
                                 device. This usually excludes executables and dynamic libraries.
                                 They might still be uploaded, if they contain additional
                                 processable information (see other flags).
      --no-debug                 Do not scan for debugging information. This will usually exclude
                                 debug companion files. They might still be uploaded, if they
                                 contain additional processable information (see other flags).
      --quiet                    Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code. This
                                 flag is currently implemented only for selected subcommands.
                                 [aliases: --silent]
      --no-sources               Do not scan for source information. This will usually exclude
                                 source bundle files. They might still be uploaded, if they contain
                                 additional processable information (see other flags).
      --id <ID>                  Search for specific debug identifiers.
      --require-all              Errors if not all identifiers specified with --id could be found.
      --symbol-maps <PATH>       Optional path to BCSymbolMap files which are used to resolve hidden
                                 symbols in dSYM files downloaded from iTunes Connect.  This
                                 requires the dsymutil tool to be available.  This should not be
                                 used when using the App Store Connect integration, the .bcsymbolmap
                                 files needed for the integration are uploaded without this option
                                 if they are found in the PATH searched for symbol files.
      --derived-data             Search for debug symbols in Xcode's derived data.
      --no-zips                  Do not search in ZIP files.
      --no-upload                Disable the actual upload.
                                 This runs all steps for the processing but does not trigger the
                                 upload.  This is useful if you just want to verify the setup or
                                 skip the upload in tests.
      --include-sources          Include sources from the local file system and upload them as
                                 source bundles.
      --wait                     Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files. Errors can
                                 only be displayed if --wait or --wait-for is specified, but this
                                 will significantly slow down the upload process.
      --wait-for <SECS>          Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files, but at most
                                 for the given number of seconds. Errors can only be displayed if
                                 --wait or --wait-for is specified, but this will significantly slow
                                 down the upload process.
      --il2cpp-mapping           Compute il2cpp line mappings and upload them along with sources.
  -h, --help                     Print help
