sentry-cli[EXE]-debug-files-upload 
Upload debugging information files.

USAGE:
    sentry-cli[EXE] debug-files upload [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

ARGS:
    <PATH>...    A path to search recursively for symbol files.

OPTIONS:
        --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>    Use the given Sentry auth token.
        --derived-data               Search for debug symbols in Xcode's derived data.
        --force-foreground           Wait for the process to finish.
                                     By default, the upload process will detach and continue in the
                                     background when triggered from Xcode.  When an error happens, a
                                     dialog is shown.  If this parameter is passed Xcode will wait
                                     for the process to finish before the build finishes and output
                                     will be shown in the Xcode build output.
    -h, --help                       Print help information
        --header <KEY:VALUE>         Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
                                     in key:value format.
        --id <ID>                    Search for specific debug identifiers.
        --il2cpp-mapping             Compute il2cpp line mappings and upload them along with
                                     sources.
        --include-sources            Include sources from the local file system and upload them as
                                     source bundles.
        --info-plist <PATH>          Optional path to the Info.plist.
                                     We will try to find this automatically if run from Xcode.
                                     Providing this information will associate the debug symbols
                                     with a specific ITC application and build in Sentry.  Note that
                                     if you provide the plist explicitly it must already be
                                     processed.
        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>      Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug,
                                     info, warn, error]
        --no-debug                   Do not scan for debugging information. This will usually
                                     exclude debug companion files. They might still be uploaded, if
                                     they contain additional processable information (see other
                                     flags).
        --no-reprocessing            Do not trigger reprocessing after uploading.
        --no-sources                 Do not scan for source information. This will usually exclude
                                     source bundle files. They might still be uploaded, if they
                                     contain additional processable information (see other flags).
        --no-unwind                  Do not scan for stack unwinding information. Specify this flag
                                     for builds with disabled FPO, or when stackwalking occurs on
                                     the device. This usually excludes executables and dynamic
                                     libraries. They might still be uploaded, if they contain
                                     additional processable information (see other flags).
        --no-upload                  Disable the actual upload.
                                     This runs all steps for the processing but does not trigger the
                                     upload (this also automatically disables reprocessing).  This
                                     is useful if you just want to verify the setup or skip the
                                     upload in tests.
        --no-zips                    Do not search in ZIP files.
    -o, --org <ORG>                  The organization slug
    -p, --project <PROJECT>          The project slug.
        --quiet                      Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code.
                                     This flag is currently implemented only for selected
                                     subcommands. [aliases: silent]
        --require-all                Errors if not all identifiers specified with --id could be
                                     found.
        --symbol-maps <PATH>         Optional path to BCSymbolMap files which are used to resolve
                                     hidden symbols in dSYM files downloaded from iTunes Connect.
                                     This requires the dsymutil tool to be available.  This should
                                     not be used when using the App Store Connect integration, the
                                     .bcsymbolmap files needed for the integration are uploaded
                                     without this option if they are found in the PATH searched for
                                     symbol files.
    -t, --type <TYPE>                Only consider debug information files of the given type.  By
                                     default, all types are considered. [possible values: dsym, elf,
                                     breakpad, pdb, pe, sourcebundle, bcsymbolmap]
        --wait                       Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files. Errors can
                                     only be displayed if --wait is specified, but this will
                                     significantly slow down the upload process.
