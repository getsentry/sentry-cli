$ sentry-cli send-envelope --help
? success
Send a stored envelope to Sentry.

This command will validate and attempt to send an envelope to Sentry. Due to network errors, rate
limits or sampling the envelope is not guaranteed to actually arrive. Check debug output for
transmission errors by passing --log-level=debug or setting `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
