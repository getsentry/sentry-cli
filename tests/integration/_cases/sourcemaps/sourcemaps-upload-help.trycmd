$ sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --help
? success
Upload sourcemaps for a release.

Usage: sentry-cli[EXE] sourcemaps upload [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

Arguments:
  [PATHS]...  The files to upload.

Options:
  -o, --org <ORG>
          The organization slug
      --header <KEY:VALUE>
          Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
          in key:value format.
  -p, --project <PROJECT>
          The project slug.
  -u, --url-prefix <PREFIX>
          The URL prefix to prepend to all filenames.
      --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>
          Use the given Sentry auth token.
  -r, --release <RELEASE>
          The release slug.
      --url-suffix <SUFFIX>
          The URL suffix to append to all filenames.
  -d, --dist <DISTRIBUTION>
          Optional distribution identifier for the sourcemaps.
      --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]
      --note <NOTE>
          Adds an optional note to the uploaded artifact bundle.
      --quiet
          Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code. This flag is currently
          implemented only for selected subcommands. [aliases: silent]
      --validate
          Enable basic sourcemap validation.
      --decompress
          Enable files gzip decompression prior to upload.
      --wait
          Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files.
      --wait-for <SECS>
          Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files, but at most for the given number of
          seconds.
      --no-sourcemap-reference
          Disable emitting of automatic sourcemap references.
          By default the tool will store a 'Sourcemap' header with minified files so that sourcemaps
          are located automatically if the tool can detect a link. If this causes issues it can be
          disabled.
      --debug-id-reference
          Enable emitting of automatic debug id references.
          By default Debug ID reference has to be present both in the source and the related
          sourcemap. But in cases of binary bundles, the tool can't verify presence of the Debug ID.
          This flag allows use of Debug ID from the linked sourcemap.
      --no-rewrite
          Disables rewriting of matching sourcemaps. By default the tool will rewrite sources, so
          that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible.
          This fundamentally changes the upload process to be based on sourcemaps and minified files
          exclusively and comes in handy for setups like react-native that generate sourcemaps that
          would otherwise not work for sentry.
      --strip-prefix <PREFIX>
          Strips the given prefix from all sources references inside the upload sourcemaps (paths
          used within the sourcemap content, to map minified code to it's original source). Only
          sources that start with the given prefix will be stripped.
          This will not modify the uploaded sources paths. To do that, point the upload or
          upload-sourcemaps command to a more precise directory instead.
      --strip-common-prefix
          Similar to --strip-prefix but strips the most common prefix on all sources references.
  -i, --ignore <IGNORE>
          Ignores all files and folders matching the given glob
  -I, --ignore-file <IGNORE_FILE>
          Ignore all files and folders specified in the given ignore file, e.g. .gitignore.
      --bundle <BUNDLE>
          Path to the application bundle (indexed, file, or regular)
      --bundle-sourcemap <BUNDLE_SOURCEMAP>
          Path to the bundle sourcemap
      --no-dedupe
          Skip artifacts deduplication prior to uploading. This will force all artifacts to be
          uploaded, no matter whether they are already present on the server.
  -x, --ext <EXT>
          Set the file extensions that are considered for upload. This overrides the default
          extensions. To add an extension, all default extensions must be repeated. Specify once per
          extension.
          Defaults to: `--ext=js --ext=map --ext=jsbundle --ext=bundle`
  -h, --help
          Print help
