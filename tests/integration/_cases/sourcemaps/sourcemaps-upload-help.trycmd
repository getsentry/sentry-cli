sentry-cli[EXE]-sourcemaps-upload 
Upload sourcemaps for a release.

USAGE:
    sentry-cli[EXE] sourcemaps upload [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

ARGS:
    <PATHS>...    The files to upload.

OPTIONS:
        --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>
            Use the given Sentry auth token.

        --bundle <BUNDLE>
            Path to the application bundle (indexed, file, or regular)

        --bundle-sourcemap <BUNDLE_SOURCEMAP>
            Path to the bundle sourcemap

    -d, --dist <DISTRIBUTION>
            Optional distribution identifier for the sourcemaps.

        --decompress
            Enable files gzip decompression prior to upload.

    -h, --help
            Print help information

        --header <KEY:VALUE>
            Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
            in key:value format.

    -i, --ignore <IGNORE>
            Ignores all files and folders matching the given glob

    -I, --ignore-file <IGNORE_FILE>
            Ignore all files and folders specified in the given ignore file, e.g. .gitignore.

        --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
            Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

        --no-rewrite
            Disables rewriting of matching sourcemaps. By default the tool will rewrite sources, so
            that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible.
            This fundamentally changes the upload process to be based on sourcemaps and minified
            files exclusively and comes in handy for setups like react-native that generate
            sourcemaps that would otherwise not work for sentry.

        --no-sourcemap-reference
            Disable emitting of automatic sourcemap references.
            By default the tool will store a 'Sourcemap' header with minified files so that
            sourcemaps are located automatically if the tool can detect a link. If this causes
            issues it can be disabled.

    -o, --org <ORG>
            The organization slug

    -p, --project <PROJECT>
            The project slug.

        --quiet
            Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code. This flag is currently
            implemented only for selected subcommands. [aliases: silent]

    -r, --release <RELEASE>
            The release slug.

        --strip-common-prefix
            Similar to --strip-prefix but strips the most common prefix on all sources references.

        --strip-prefix <PREFIX>
            Strips the given prefix from all sources references inside the upload sourcemaps (paths
            used within the sourcemap content, to map minified code to it's original source). Only
            sources that start with the given prefix will be stripped.
            This will not modify the uploaded sources paths. To do that, point the upload or
            upload-sourcemaps command to a more precise directory instead.

    -u, --url-prefix <PREFIX>
            The URL prefix to prepend to all filenames.

        --url-suffix <SUFFIX>
            The URL suffix to append to all filenames.

        --validate
            Enable basic sourcemap validation.

        --wait
            Wait for the server to fully process uploaded files.

    -x, --ext <EXT>
            Set the file extensions that are considered for upload. This overrides the default
            extensions. To add an extension, all default extensions must be repeated. Specify once
            per extension.
            Defaults to: `--ext=js --ext=map --ext=jsbundle --ext=bundle`

```
