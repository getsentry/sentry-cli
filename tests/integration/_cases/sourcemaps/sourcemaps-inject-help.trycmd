$ sentry-cli sourcemaps inject --help
? success
Fixes up JavaScript source files and sourcemaps with debug ids.

For every minified JS source file, a debug id is generated and inserted into the file. If the source
file references a sourcemap and that sourcemap is locally available, the debug id will be injected
into it as well. If the referenced sourcemap already contains a debug id, that id is used instead.

Usage: sentry-cli[EXE] sourcemaps inject [OPTIONS] <PATHS>...

Arguments:
  <PATHS>...
          A path to recursively search for javascript files that should be processed.

Options:
  -i, --ignore <IGNORE>
          Ignores all files and folders matching the given glob

  -o, --org <ORG>
          The organization ID or slug.

      --header <KEY:VALUE>
          Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
          in key:value format.

  -I, --ignore-file <IGNORE_FILE>
          Ignore all files and folders specified in the given ignore file, e.g. .gitignore.

  -p, --project <PROJECT>
          The project ID or slug.

      --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>
          Use the given Sentry auth token.

  -r, --release <RELEASE>
          The release slug.

  -x, --ext <EXT>
          Set the file extensions of JavaScript files that are considered for injection.  This
          overrides the default extensions (js, cjs, mjs).  To add an extension, all default
          extensions must be repeated.  Specify once per extension.  Source maps are discovered via
          those files.

      --dry-run
          Don't modify files on disk.

      --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error]

      --quiet
          Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code. This flag is currently
          implemented only for selected subcommands.
          
          [aliases: --silent]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
