$ sentry-cli sourcemaps inject --help
? success
Fixes up JavaScript source files and sourcemaps with debug ids.

For every JS source file that references a sourcemap, a debug id is generated and inserted into both
files. If the referenced sourcemap already contains a debug id, that id is used instead.

Usage: sentry-cli[EXE] sourcemaps inject [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

Arguments:
  [PATHS]...
          A path to recursively search for javascript files that should be processed.

Options:
      --dry-run
          Don't modify files on disk.

  -o, --org <ORG>
          The organization slug

      --header <KEY:VALUE>
          Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
          in key:value format.

  -p, --project <PROJECT>
