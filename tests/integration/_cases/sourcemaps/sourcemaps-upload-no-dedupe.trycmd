  WARN    [..] [DEPRECATION NOTICE] Your Sentry server does not support artifact bundle uploads. Falling back to deprecated release bundle upload. Support for this deprecated upload method will be removed in Sentry CLI 3.0.0. Please upgrade your Sentry server, or if you cannot upgrade, pin your Sentry CLI version to 2.x, so you don't get upgraded to 3.x when it is released.
