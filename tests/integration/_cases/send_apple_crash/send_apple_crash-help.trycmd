$ sentry-cli send-apple-crash --help
? success
Send Apple crash reports to Sentry.

This command parses Apple crash report files in .ips (JSON) format and sends them to Sentry as
error events. Sentry will automatically symbolicate the crash reports if matching debug symbols
(dSYMs) have been uploaded.

Due to network errors, rate limits or sampling the event is not guaranteed to actually arrive.
Check debug output for transmission errors by passing --log-level=debug or setting
`SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
