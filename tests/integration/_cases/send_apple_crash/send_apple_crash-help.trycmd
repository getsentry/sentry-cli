$ sentry-cli send-apple-crash --help
? success
Send Apple crash reports (.ips) to Sentry.

This command parses Apple crash report files in .ips (JSON) format and sends them to Sentry as error
events. Sentry will automatically symbolicate the crash reports if matching debug symbols (dSYMs)
have been uploaded.

Due to network errors, rate limits or sampling the event is not guaranteed to actually arrive. Check
debug output for transmission errors by passing --log-level=debug or setting
`SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
