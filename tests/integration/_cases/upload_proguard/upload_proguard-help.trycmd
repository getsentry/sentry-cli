$ sentry-cli upload-proguard --help
? success
Upload ProGuard mapping files to a project.

Usage: sentry-cli[EXE] upload-proguard [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

Arguments:
  [PATH]...  The path to the mapping files.

Options:
  -o, --org <ORG>                    The organization ID or slug.
      --header <KEY:VALUE>           Custom headers that should be attached to all requests
                                     in key:value format.
  -p, --project <PROJECT>            The project ID or slug.
      --auth-token <AUTH_TOKEN>      Use the given Sentry auth token.
      --version <VERSION>            Optionally associate the mapping files with a human readable
                                     version.
                                     This helps you understand which ProGuard files go with which
                                     version of your app.
      --version-code <VERSION_CODE>  Optionally associate the mapping files with a version code.
                                     This helps you understand which ProGuard files go with which
                                     version of your app.
      --app-id <APP_ID>              Optionally associate the mapping files with an application ID.
                                     If you have multiple apps in one sentry project, you can then
                                     easily tell them apart.
      --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>        Set the log output verbosity. [possible values: trace, debug,
                                     info, warn, error]
      --platform <PLATFORM>          Optionally defines the platform for the app association.
                                     [defaults to 'android']
      --quiet                        Do not print any output while preserving correct exit code.
                                     This flag is currently implemented only for selected
                                     subcommands. [aliases: --silent]
      --no-upload                    Disable the actual upload.
                                     This runs all steps for the processing but does not trigger the
                                     upload.  This is useful if you just want to verify the mapping
                                     files and write the proguard UUIDs into a properties file.
      --write-properties <PATH>      Write the UUIDs for the processed mapping files into the given
                                     properties file.
      --require-one                  Requires at least one file to upload or the command will error.
  -u, --uuid <UUID>                  Explicitly override the UUID of the mapping file with another
                                     one.
                                     This should be used with caution as it means that you can
                                     upload multiple mapping files if you don't take care.  This
                                     however can be useful if you have a build process in which you
                                     need to know the UUID of the proguard file before it was
                                     created.  If you upload a file with a forced UUID you can only
                                     upload a single proguard file.
  -h, --help                         Print help
