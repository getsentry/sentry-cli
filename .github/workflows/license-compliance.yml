          ## License acknowledgements outdated ❌

          The `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file is out of date with the current dependencies. Maintaining an up-to-date acknowledgements is required to comply with most open source licenses, as we distribute compiled copies of dependency code in our binaries.

          ### Why did this check fail? 🤔

          There are several reasons why this check might have failed. Typically, this happens if one of the following scenarios occurred, and the `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file was not updated:
            - A (transitive) dependency was added, removed, or updated.
            - As `cargo-about` fetches some license data from external services, the external service might have changed the license text.

          ### How to debug 🔍

          1. **Check the diff above** to see what changed
          2. **Download the artifact**: The CI-generated `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file has been uploaded as an artifact named `generated-acknowledgements`. You can download it from the workflow run summary page.
          3. **Compare locally**: Download the artifact and compare it with your local version to identify platform-specific differences.

          ### How to fix 🛠️

          First, ensure you have `cargo-about` installed:

          ```sh
          cargo install cargo-about --version 0.8.2
          ```

          Then, generate the `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` file:

          ```sh
          cargo about generate --locked ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md.hbs > ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md
          ```

          Finally, commit the changes and push them to this PR 🚀
