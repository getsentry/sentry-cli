# Sentry CLI

This is the repository for Sentry CLI, the official command line interface for Sentry.

Sentry CLI can be used for many tasks, including uploading debug symbols and source maps to Sentry, managing releases, and viewing Sentry data such as issues and logs.

## Installation and Usage

Please refer to [Sentry CLI's documentation page](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/).

## Compiling

In case you want to compile this yourself, you need to install at minimum the
following dependencies:

* Rust stable and Cargo
* Make, CMake and a C compiler

Use cargo to compile:

    $ cargo build

Also, there is a Dockerfile that builds an Alpine-based Docker image with
`sentry-cli` in the PATH. To build and use it, run:

```sh
docker build -t sentry-cli .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work sentry-cli --help
```
