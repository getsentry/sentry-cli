This is a Sentry command line client for some generic tasks.  Right now this
is primarily used to upload debug symbols to Sentry if you are not using the
fastlane tools.

 - Binaries can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/)
 - Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.sentry.io/hosted/learn/cli/)

## Installation

The recommended way to install is with everybody's favorite curl to bash:

    curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | bash

Additionally you can also install this binary via npm:

    npm install sentry-cli-binary

When installing globally, make sure to have set [correct permissions on the global node_modules directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
If this is not possible in your environment or still produces an EACCESS error, install as root:

    sudo npm install -g sentry-cli-binary --unsafe-perm

Or homebrew:

    brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli

## Compiling

In case you want to compile this yourself you need to build this with Rust
1.15 or later.

Use rustup to compile:

    $ cargo build

In case you get OpenSSL errors you need to compile with the path to the
OpenSSL headers.  For instance:

    $ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ cargo build

## Alpine Linux

If you want to run sentry-cli in Alpine (popular with Docker), you need to compile it yourself. Here's an example Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM alpine

ENV SENTRY_VERSION="1.18.0"

RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps \
		build-base \
		cargo \
		cmake \
		curl \
		curl-dev \
		file \
		gcc \
		openssl \
		openssl-dev \
		rust \
	&& cd /tmp \
	&& curl -LO https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/archive/$SENTRY_VERSION.tar.gz \
	&& tar -xzf $SENTRY_VERSION.tar.gz \
	&& cargo build --manifest-path sentry-cli-$SENTRY_VERSION/Cargo.toml --release \
	&& mv sentry-cli-$SENTRY_VERSION/target/release/sentry-cli /usr/local/bin \
	&& rm -rf /tmp/* \
	&& rm -rf /root/.cargo \
	&& apk del .build-deps \
	&& apk add --no-cache curl llvm-libunwind openssl
```
