This is a Sentry command line client for some generic tasks. Right now this is
primarily used to upload debug symbols to Sentry if you are not using the
fastlane tools.

* Downloads can be found under
  [Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/)
* Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.sentry.io/hosted/learn/cli/)

## Installation

The recommended way to install is with everybody's favorite curl to bash:

    curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | bash

### Node

Additionally you can also install this binary via npm:

    npm install @sentry/cli

When installing globally, make sure to have set
[correct permissions on the global node_modules directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).
If this is not possible in your environment or still produces an EACCESS error,
install as root:

    sudo npm install -g @sentry/cli --unsafe-perm

By default, this package will download sentry-cli from the CDN managed by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/).
To use a custom CDN, set the npm config property `sentrycli_cdnurl`. The downloader will append
`"/<version>/sentry-cli-<dist>"`.

```sh
npm install @sentry/cli --sentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path
```

Or add property into your `.npmrc` file (https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/npmrc.html)

```rc
sentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path
```

Another option is to use the environment variable `SENTRYCLI_CDNURL`.

```sh
SENTRYCLI_CDNURL=https://mymirror.local/path npm install @sentry/cli
```

If you're installing the CLI with NPM from behind a proxy, the install script will
use either NPM's configured HTTPS proxy server, or the value from your `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variable.

### Homebrew

A homebrew recipe is provided in the `getsentry/tools` tap:

    brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli

### Docker

As of version _1.25.0_, there is an official Docker image that comes with
`sentry-cli` preinstalled. If you prefer a specific version, specify it as tag.
The latest development version is published under the `edge` tag. In production,
we recommend you to use the `latest` tag. To use it, run:

```sh
docker pull getsentry/sentry-cli
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work getsentry/sentry-cli --help
```

## Compiling

In case you want to compile this yourself, you need to install at minimum the
following dependencies:

* Rust 1.23 and Cargo
* Make, CMake and a C compiler
* OpenSSL 1.0.2n with development headers
* Curl 7.50 with development headers

Use cargo to compile:

    $ cargo build

In case you get OpenSSL errors you need to compile with the path to the OpenSSL
headers. For instance:

    $ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ cargo build

Also, there is a Dockerfile that builds an Alpine-based Docker image with
`sentry-cli` in the PATH. To build and use it, run:

```sh
docker build -t sentry-cli .
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work sentry-cli --help
```
