Breakpad Symbol Upload
======================

``sentry-cli`` can upload Breakpad symbols generated by the ``dump_syms`` tool
to Sentry to allow symbolication of Minidump crash reports.  Breakpad uses an
platform independent ASCII format to store debug information.  Such files are
usually generated for applications using Breakpad, Crashpad or the Electron
Framework.

.. admonition:: Hint

    If possible, upload native debug files, such as :doc:`dSYM files <dsym>` or
    :doc:`ELF symbols <elf>` instead of Breakpad symbols.  They contain more
    information and allow for higher quality stack traces.  Please refer to
    the linked resources for more information.

Basic Upload
------------

Use ``upload-dif`` to upload Breakpad symbols and specify the ``breakpad`` type.
The command will recurively scan the provided folders or ZIP archives.

.. admonition:: Note

    Because debug files belong to projects, you will need to specify the
    organization and project you are working with.  For more information
    about this refer to :ref:`sentry-cli-working-with-projects`.

Example::

    $ sentry-cli upload-dif -t breakpad .

Upload Options
--------------

There are a few options you can supply for the upload process

``--no-zips``
    By default, sentry-cli will open and search ZIP archives for files. This is
    especially useful when downloading builds from iTunes Connect. Use this
    switch to disable if your search paths contain large ZIP archives without
    debug information files to speed up the search.

``--no-reprocessing``
    This parameter prevents Sentry from triggering reprocessing right
    away.  It can be useful in some limited circumstances where you want
    to upload files in multiple batches and you want to ensure that Sentry
    does not start reprocessing before some optional dsyms are uploaded.
    Note though that someone can still in the meantime trigger
    reprocessing from the UI.
