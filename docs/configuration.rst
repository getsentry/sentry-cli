Configuration and Authentication
================================

For most functionality you need to authenticate with Sentry.  To sign the
CLI tool in you can use the `login` command which will guide you through
it::

    $ sentry-cli login

If you want to manually authenticate ``sentry-cli`` you can to your to
your auth token settings in your user account (User Icon -> API) and
generate a new token.  Afterwards you can export the ``SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN``
environment variable::

    export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

Alternatively you can provide the ``--auth-token`` command line parameter
whenever you invoke `sentry-cli` or add it to your `.sentryclirc` config
file.

By default ``sentry-cli`` will connect to sentry.io but for
on-premise you can also sign in elsewhere::

    $ sentry-cli --url https://myserver.invalid/ login

Configuration File
------------------

The `sentry-cli` tool can be configured with a config file named
:file:`.sentryclirc` as well as environment variables and `.env` files.
The config file is looked for upwards from the current path and defaults
from `~/.sentryclirc` are always loaded.  You can also override these
settings from command line parameters.

The config file uses standard INI syntax.

By default ``sentry-cli`` will connect to sentry.io.  For on-prem you can
export the ``SENTRY_URL`` environment variable and point it to your
installation::

    export SENTRY_URL=https://mysentry.invalid/

Alternatively you can add it to your ``~/.sentryclirc`` config.  This
is also what the `login` command does:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [defaults]
    url = https://mysentry.invalid/

.. admonition:: .env file loading

   By default sentry-cli loads .env files.  On versions of sentry-cli
   1.24 and newer you can disable this by exporting an environment
   variable ``SENTRY_LOAD_DOTENV=0``.


Configuration Values
--------------------

The following settings are available (first is the environment variable, the
value in the parentheses is the config key in the config file):

``SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`` (`auth.token`):
    the authentication token to use for all communication with Sentry.
``SENTRY_API_KEY`` (`auth.api_key`):
    the legacy API key for authentication if you have one.
``SENTRY_URL`` (`defaults.url`):
    The URL to use to connect to sentry.  This defaults to
    ``https://sentry.io/``.
``SENTRY_ORG`` (`defaults.org`):
    the slug of the organization to use for a command.
``SENTRY_PROJECT`` (`defaults.project`):
    the slug of the project to use for a command.
(`http.keepalive`):
    This ini only setting is used to control the behavior of the SDK
    with regards to HTTP keepalives.  The default is `true` but it can
    be set to `false` to disable keepalive support.
``http_proxy`` (`http.proxy_url`):
    The URL that should be used for the HTTP proxy.  The standard
    ``http_proxy`` environment variable is also honored.  Note that it
    is lowercase.
(`http.proxy_username`):
    This ini only setting sets the proxy username in case proxy
    authentication is required.
(`http.proxy_password`):
    This ini only setting sets the proxy password in case proxy
    authentication is required.
(`http.verify_ssl`):
    This can be used to disable SSL verification when set to false.  You
    should never do that unless you are working with a known self signed
    server locally.
(`http.check_ssl_revoke`):
    If this is set to false then SSL revocation checks are disabled on
    Windows.  This can be useful when working with a corporate SSL MITM
    proxy that does not properly implement revocation checks.  Do not use
    this unless absolutely necessary.
(`ui.show_notifications`):
    If this is set to false some operating system notifications are
    disabled.  This currently primarily affects xcode builds which
    will not show notifications for background builds.
``SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL`` (`log.level`):
    Configures the log level for the SDK.  The default is ``warning``.
    If you want to see what the library is doing you can set it to
    ``info`` which will spit out more information which might help to
    debug some issues with permissions.
(`dsym.max_upload_size`):
    Sets the maximum upload size in bytes (before compression) of debug
    symbols into one batch.  The default is 35MB or 100MB (depending on
    the version of sentry-cli) which is suitable for sentry.io but if you
    are using a different sentry server you might want to change this
    limit if necessary.
``SENTRY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`` (`update.disable_check`):
    If set to ``true`` then the automatic update check in sentry-cli is
    disabled.  This was introduced in 1.17.  Versions before that did not
    include an update check.  The update check is also not enabled for npm
    based installations of sentry-cli at the moment.

Validating The Config
---------------------

To make sure everything works you can run ``sentry-cli info`` and it should
print out some basic information about the Sentry installation you connect
to as well as some authentication information.

.. _sentry-cli-working-with-projects:

Working with Projects
---------------------

Many commands require you to specify the organization and project to work
with.  There are multiple ways in which you can specify this.

Config Defaults
```````````````

If you are always working with the same projects you can set it in the
``.sentryclirc`` file:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    [defaults]
    project=my-project
    org=my-org

Environment Variables
`````````````````````

You can also set these defaults in environment variables.  There are two
environment vaiables that control this (``SENTRY_ORG`` and
``SENTRY_PROJECT``)  which you can export::

    export SENTRY_ORG=my-org
    export SENTRY_PROJECT=my-project

Properties Files
````````````````

Additionally ``sentry-cli`` supports loading configuration values from
``.properties`` files (common in the Java environment).  You can instruct
``sentry-cli`` to load config files from there by exporting the path to a
properties file in the ``SENTRY_PROPERTIES`` environment variable.  This
is commonly done automatically for some of our client integrations like
Java and React-Native.

Inside the properties files you just use the dotted notation to set
values.  Example:

.. sourcecode:: ini

    defaults.url=https://mysentry.invalid/

To then instruct ``sentry-cli`` to use that file use this::

    export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=/path/to/sentry.properties
    sentry-cli ...

Explicit Options
````````````````

Lastly you can provide these values also explicitly with the command you
are executing.  The parameters are always called ``--org`` or ``-o`` for
the organization and ``--project`` or ``-p`` for the project.

Note that they do not always go to the same command.  For instance if you
are managing releases (which are shared across the organization) you
usuallys supply the organiation to the ``releases`` command but the
projects to the subcommand on it::

    $ sentry-cli releases -o my-org new -p my-project 1.0

For more information use the ``help`` command which will give you a
documentation of all parameters.
